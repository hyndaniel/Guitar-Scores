       C 
do you hear the people sing 
            Fm              C 
singing the song of angry men
          Am       D      
it is the music of people who will 
G
not be salve again
         C 
when the beating of your heart 
          Fm              C
echos the beating of the drums
           Am         D
there is a life about to start
G             C        
when tomorrow comes

         Em          
Will you join in our crusade?
            Bm            
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Am
Beyond the barricade
            Em
Is there a world you long to see?
     C
Then join in the fight
                                   D
That will give you the right to be free!

Will you give all you can give
            Bm            
So that our banner may advance
Am
Some will fall and some will live
            Em
Will you stand up and take your chance?
     C
The blood of the martyrs
                          D
Will water the meadows of France!
